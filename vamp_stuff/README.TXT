Vampiric Stuff v1.3 - Axema Vales (author)

https://discourse.cataclysmdda.org - CDDA official website



  ~ THE MOD FOCUSES ON ADDING VAMPIRES TO YOUR WORLD, ALONG WITH THE NEW LOCATIONS TO EXPLORE, QUESTS TO COMPLETE, ITEMS TO DISCOVER AND MONSTERS TO ERADICATE!
  ~ 

  * After the major fixes in v1.2, the v1.3 plans to improve the 'still' broken npc dialogues, especially the lore (npcs talk plainly, filthy stories, missions garbled to situation problems like 'I need blood', but not really). Also, arcana's unique features will spice up this mod as I aim to link them for extended possibilities :)
  
  NOTE: Turn on static npcs in your world settings, or you won't see any npcs in almost all locations.

+  INTRODUCED VAMPIRIC STUFF



  $ The flow is quest dependent, and actually follows this path:
  
	YOU => CRYPT => COVE => OUTSKIRTS => (WIP)

  $ If you've come to the outskirts even without meeting an isolated vampire first doesn't affect the gameplay at all. BUT you wont get the supplies from the cove like books to access the unique bloodcrafts.
